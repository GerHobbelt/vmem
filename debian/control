Package: libvmem1
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory volatile memory support library
 The libvmem library turns a pool of persistent memory into a volatile memory
 pool, similar to the system heap but kept separate and with its own
 malloc-style API.
 .
 libvmem supports the traditional malloc/free interfaces on a memory mapped
 file.  This allows the use of persistent memory as volatile memory, for cases
 where the pool of persistent memory is useful to an application, but when the
 application doesn’t need it to be persistent.

# Dropping these -- let's see if anyone complains.

Description: development files for libvmem1

Package: libvmmalloc1
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory dynamic allocation support library
 The libvmmalloc library transparently converts all the dynamic memory
 allocations into volatile persistent memory allocations.  This allows the
 use of persistent memory as volatile memory without modifying the target
 application.
